abstract: Awe and wonder are theorised to be distinct from other positive emotions,
  such as happiness. Yet little empirical or theoretical work has focused on these
  emotions. This investigation explored differences in language used to describe experiences
  of awe and wonder. Such analyses can provide insight into how people conceptualise
  these emotional experiences, and whether they conceptualise these emotions to be
  distinct from other positive emotions, and each other. Participants wrote narratives
  about experiences of awe, wonder and happiness. There were differences in the language
  used to describe these positive emotional states, consistent with the theorised
  functions of each emotion. Awe was related to observing the world, reflected in
  greater use of perception words. Wonder was related to trying to understand the
  world, reflected in greater use of cognitive complexity and tentative words. Language
  use for both emotions reflected an environmental focus, whereas language use for
  happiness reflected a social/relationship focus.
