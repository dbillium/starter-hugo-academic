abstract: Humans have a tendency to endorse teleological beliefs about the world.
  According to terror management theory, teleological or purposeful beliefs about
  the world help people cope with the awareness of mortality. Though research is generally
  consistent with this assertion, it has not been directly tested. Three studies tested
  and supported the notion that teleological beliefs about the world serve a terror
  management function. In “Study 1”, experimentally elevated teleological beliefs
  reduced death-thought accessibility. In “Studies 2 and 3”, mortality salience increased
  teleological beliefs, even if this resulted in judgment errors. Alternative explanations
  were tested and did not account for the findings.
