abstract: 'This dataset is from the Many Labs Replication Project in which 13 effects
  were replicated across 36 samples and over 6,000 participants. Data from the replications
  are included, along with demographic variables about the participants and contextual
  information about the environment in which the replication was conducted. Data were
  collected in-lab and online through a standardized procedure administered via an
  online link. The dataset is stored on the Open Science Framework website. These
  data could be used to further investigate the results of the included 13 effects
  or to study replication and generalizability more broadly.Keywords: replication,  generalizability,  context'
