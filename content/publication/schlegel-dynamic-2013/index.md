abstract: The present research used multiple methods to examine the hypothesis that
  perceived true self-knowledge and decision satisfaction are inextricably linked
  together by a widely held “true-self-as-guide” lay theory of decision making. Consistent
  with this proposition, Study 1 found that participants rated using the true self
  as a guide as more important for achieving personal satisfaction than a variety
  of other potential decision-making strategies. After establishing the prevalence
  of this lay theory, the remaining studies then focused on examining the proposed
  consequent relationship between perceived true self-knowledge and decision satisfaction.
  Consistent with hypotheses, 2 cross-sectional correlational studies (Studies 2 and
  3) found a positive relationship between perceived true self-knowledge and decision
  satisfaction for different types of major decisions. Study 4 used daily diary methods
  to demonstrate that fluctuations in perceived true self-knowledge reliably covary
  with fluctuations in decision satisfaction. Finally, 2 studies directly examined
  the causal direction of this relationship through experimental manipulation and
  revealed that the relationship is truly bidirectional. More specifically, Study
  5 showed that manipulating perceived knowledge of the true self (but not other self-concepts)
  directly affects decision satisfaction. Study 6 showed that this effect also works
  in reverse by manipulating feelings of decision satisfaction, which directly affected
  perceived knowledge of the true self (but not other self-concepts). Taken together,
  these studies suggest that people believe the true self should be used as a guide
  when making major life decisions and that this belief has observable consequences
  for the self and decision making. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights
