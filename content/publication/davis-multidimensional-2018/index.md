abstract: "Multidimensional models of perfectionism predict important outcomes for\
  \ existing interpersonal relationships, but limited research has examined multidimensional\
  \ perfectionism in the context of initial attraction and evaluation of potential\
  \ relationship partners (cf. Hoffmann, Stoeber, & Musch, 2015). In this preregistered\
  \ within-subjects experiment, 381 participants from the United States completed\
  \ an online survey rating their interest in potential relationships with and stereotypes\
  \ of five potential relationship partner profiles: self-oriented, socially prescribed,\
  \ and other-oriented perfectionists, a non-perfectionist, and a baseline profile\
  \ not mentioning perfectionism. Baseline and non-perfectionist profiles received\
  \ the highest ratings of likability, desire to be in a relationship, and warmth\
  \ followed by the socially prescribed, self-oriented, then other-oriented perfectionist\
  \ profiles. In contrast, self-oriented perfectionists were rated as more competent\
  \ than self-oriented or other-oriented perfectionists. Participants anticipated\
  \ being less happy in long term and high investment relationships with perfectionists\
  \ compared to short term and low investment relationships, whereas the opposite\
  \ pattern was true for the baseline and non-perfectionist profiles. Finally, participants'\
  \ own self-oriented, socially prescribed, and other oriented perfectionism each\
  \ positively predicted interest in relationships with perfectionists, but did not\
  \ positively predict interest in the baseline and non-perfectionist profiles. Strengths,\
  \ limitations, and contributions to the understanding of perfectionism in relationships\
  \ are discussed."
