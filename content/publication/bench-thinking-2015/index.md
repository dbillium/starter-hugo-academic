abstract: People change over the course of their lives, yet little is known about
  how people think about these changes. We expected that evaluative judgments of changes
  would relate to the type of metaphors people use to describe those changes. Specifically,
  we predicted that the more positively a change is evaluated, the more likely it
  is to be perceived as a self “discovery” (i.e., a change driven by discovering something
  within the self). Study 1 established a correlational relationship between perceived
  positivity and self-discovery in changes in both the self and a close other. Study
  2 manipulated the valance of the change and found that positive changes were more
  likely to be endorsed as self-discoveries than negative changes. These findings
  highlight the importance of self-discovery metaphors in understanding how people
  make sense of changes in the self and close others. Implications for meaning making,
  well-being, and narrative research are discussed.
