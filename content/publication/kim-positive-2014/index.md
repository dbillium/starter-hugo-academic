abstract: The positive psychology and experimental existential psychology movements
  have greatly advanced our understanding of the variables that augment and detract
  from the personal experience of meaning in life. In this chapter, we describe differences
  in these two perspectives. In our view, experimental existential psychologists have
  primarily examined variables that contribute to a sense of meaninglessness, whereas
  positive psychologists often place more emphasis on variables that augment oneâ€™s
  belief that his or her life is meaningful. For each of these perspectives, we further
  describe variables that relate to the experience of meaninglessness and meaningfulness,
  respectively. Namely, we argue that a lack of personal freedom, social isolation,
  and self-alienation are three fundamental threats to meaning that, if experienced,
  evoke a sense of meaninglessness, whereas personal goals and a grand sense of purpose
  help augment the feeling that life is meaningful. While we do not suggest that these
  are the only variables that influence perceptions of meaning, based on current findings
  in the experimental existential and positive psychology literature, we argue that
  each of these variables represent fundamental contributors to perceptions of meaning
  (lessness) in life. Overall, we believe psychologists from both existential and
  positive psychology perspectives have made great contributions to help us understand
  the causes and consequences of the experience of meaning in life. This brief chapter
  represents an initial step to help differentiate these two complimentary perspectives
  in hopes of generating research ideas for scholars across disciplines.
