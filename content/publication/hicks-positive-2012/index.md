abstract: Four studies tested the prediction that positive affect (PA) would relate
  more strongly to meaning in life (MIL) as a function of perceived time limitations.
  In Study 1 (N = 360), adults completed measures of PA and MIL. As predicted, PA
  related more strongly to MIL for older, compared to younger, participants. In Studies
  2 and 3, adults (N = 514) indicated their current position in their life span, and
  rated their MIL. PA, whether naturally occurring (Study 2) or induced (Study 3),
  was a stronger predictor of MIL for individuals who perceived themselves as having
  a limited amount of time left to live. Finally, in Study 4 (N = 98) students completed
  a measure of PA, MIL, and future time perspective (FTP). Results showed that PA
  was more strongly linked to MIL for those who believed they had fewer opportunities
  left to pursue their goals. Overall, these findings suggest that the experience
  of PA becomes increasingly associated with the experience of MIL as the perception
  of future time becomes limited. The contribution of age related processes to judgments
  of well-being are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights
