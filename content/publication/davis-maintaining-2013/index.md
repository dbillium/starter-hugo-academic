abstract: Four studies tested the hypothesis that limited time perceptions are associated
  with lower levels of hope, and that this effect is buffered by high levels of authenticity.
  Study 1 (n = 256) utilized a cross-sectional design in which participants completed
  dispositional measures of time perspective, hope, and authenticity. Three subsequent
  studies tested our hypothesis experimentally. In a pilot study (n = 124), participants
  reported their perceived authenticity, future time perspective (FTP) was manipulated
  (limited vs. open-ended), and state hope was assessed. Study 2 (n = 156) introduced
  a new manipulation of FTP, and Study 3 (n = 242) replicated Study 2 with the addition
  of a neutral control condition. Across all studies, individuals who perceived time
  as limited reported lower levels of hope relative to those who perceived time as
  open-ended (or those in a neutral control condition), but, importantly, this effect
  was attenuated for highly authentic individuals.
