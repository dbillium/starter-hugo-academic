abstract: Research shows that alcohol-related stimuli have the propensity to capture
  attention among individuals motivated to consume alcohol. Research has further demonstrated
  that impulsive individuals are especially prone to this type of attentional bias.
  Recently, it is suggested that alcohol cue exposure can also produce a general narrowing
  of attention consistent with the activation of approach motivational states.
