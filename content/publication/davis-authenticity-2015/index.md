abstract: Extending research on optimal self-esteem and authenticity, three studies
  tested the hypothesis that authenticity would be a stronger predictor of self-esteem
  levels when time was perceived as limited as opposed to open ended. Study 1 provided
  a cross-sectional examination of the relationship between authenticity, future time
  perspective, and self-esteem in an adult sample, and Studies 2 and 3 assessed this
  relationship using repeated measures methodologies across both the short term and
  long term in college student samples. Results supported the hypothesis that authenticity
  would be a stronger predictor of self-esteem levels when time was perceived as limited.
  Across studies, individuals who felt inauthentic reported lower levels of self-esteem
  when they perceived time as limited.
