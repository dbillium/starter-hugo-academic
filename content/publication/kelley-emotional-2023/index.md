abstract: When do prosocial actors experience positive versus negative psychological
  outcomes from helping others? In four studies and an internal meta-analysis, we
  tested the hypothesis that autonomy shapes the psychological consequences of helping
  others. In Study 1, prosocial behaviour was associated with a robust pattern of
  negative well-being outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, stress) for individuals
  low but not high in autonomy. In Studies 2â€“4, relative to reflecting on a neutral
  interpersonal experience, reflecting on an autonomous helping experience increased
  sadness and happiness, strengthened intentions to help in the future and raised
  support for social welfare. By contrast, reflecting on a controlled helping experience
  increased negative emotions and decreased positive emotions, but did not affect
  attitudes or behavioural intentions. Collectively, the findings indicate that autonomy
  (or lack thereof) shapes the emotional, motivational and attitudinal consequences
  of helping behaviour.
