abstract: Over the past decade, self-administered mindfulness interventions, such
  as those administered via phone apps, have become increasingly popular. However,
  their effectiveness for regulating stress is unclear. In a multi-site study (Nsites
  = 37, Nparticipants = 2,239; all fluent English speakers) we experimentally investigated
  the efficacy of four single, stand-alone mindfulness exercises (versus three active
  control conditions) on self-reported stress with Bayesian mixed-effects models.
  All mindfulness exercises proved to be more efficacious than the active control
  conditions in reducing participants' self-reported stress levels. Between the control
  condition (M = 1.95) and the condition with the largest reduction in stress levels
  (Body Scan; M = 1.68), there was a mean difference of 0.27 on a four-point scale,
  (Cohen’s d = -.56) indicating a small decrease in stress. Our findings suggest that
  brief mindfulness exercises may be beneficial in reducing stress, even though we
  cannot fully distinguish between true effects and demand effects.
