abstract: Aims Many theoretical perspectives suggest that alcohol-related stimuli
  bear on attentional processes. Building upon these ideas and recent advances regarding
  the attention-constricting impact of approach motivational states, we predicted
  that mere exposure to alcohol-related images would suffice to reduce the breadth
  of attention among individuals who possessed a strong motivation to consume alcohol.
  Design Two studies exposed participants to alcohol and neutral cues prior to assessing
  attention structure. In both studies, measures of alcohol use, negative alcohol
  expectancies, trait approach motivation and alcohol-related approach motivation
  were assessed. Setting and participants Study 1 comprised 102 undergraduates and
  study 2 comprised 161 undergraduates. Studies were conducted at Texas A&M University,
  College Station, Texas. Measurements In both studies, participants were briefly
  exposed to pictures of various stimuli (alcohol versus neutral pictures). After
  each picture was displayed, participants completed a trial assessing attentional
  focus. Findings After controlling for relevant covariates, both studies demonstrated
  that exposure to alcohol-related pictures led to a narrowing of attentional focus
  among individuals who possessed a strong motivation to use alcohol. Exposure to
  neutral pictures, however, did not interact with alcohol-related motivation to influence
  attentional focus. Conclusions Alcohol cues narrow attentional breadth for individuals
  who are motivated to consume alcohol, suggesting a non-pharmacological means in
  which alcohol produces a narrow mindset. Alcohol cues may contribute to cognitive
  and behavioral deficits, as well as drinking behaviors, in part, because they lead
  to the inability to process a broad range of information in the environment.
