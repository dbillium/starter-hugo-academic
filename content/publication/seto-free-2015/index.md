abstract: Research has found that counterfactual reflection, the act of mentally undoing
  past events, imbues major life experiences with meaning. The current studies examined
  whether individual differences in free will beliefs moderate this relationship.
  Participants described a significant event in their lives, were randomly assigned
  to counterfactual or factual reflection about the event, and completed measures
  of meaning and free will. Two studies found that counterfactual reflection enhanced
  the meaningfulness of life events for people with high belief in free will but not
  for people with low belief in free will. These studies suggest that beliefs in free
  will are an important factor in meaning-making processes.
