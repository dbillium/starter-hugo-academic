abstract: 'How one thinks about or conceptualizes a goal has important consequences
  for the motivational features of goal pursuit. Two experiments tested the hypothesis,
  inspired by work on meaning in life, action identification theory, and expectancy-value
  theory, that high-level construal of an academic goal should enhance motivation
  to pursue that goal. In each experiment, we manipulated high-level versus low-level
  construal of an academic goal and assessed several variables related to the goal:
  the perceived meaningfulness of the goal, motivation to pursue the goal, and goal
  self-concordance. Supporting the hypothesis, individuals who thought about their
  academic goal in a high-level manner viewed their goal as more meaningful, reported
  being more motivated to pursue the goal, and reported the goal to be more self-concordant.
  Implications and future directions are discussed.'
