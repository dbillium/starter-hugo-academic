abstract: Objectives In the present study, we examined how the influence of exercise-related
  social media content on exercise motivation might differ across content type (with
  images vs. without images) and account type (individual vs. corporate). Design Using
  a 2 × 2 within-subjects experimental design, 229 participants viewed a series of
  40 actual social media posts across the four conditions (individual posts with images,
  corporate posts with images, individual posts without images, and corporate posts
  without images) in a randomized order. Method Participants rated the extent to which
  they felt each social media post motivated them to exercise, would motivate others
  to exercise, and was posted for extrinsic reasons. Participants also completed other
  measures of individual differences including their own exercise motivation. Results
  Posts with images from individuals were more motivating than posts with images from
  corporations; however, corporate posts without images were more motivating than
  posts without images from individuals. Participants expected others to be similarly
  motivated by the stimuli, and perceived corporate posts as having been posted for
  more extrinsic reasons than individuals’ posts. Conclusions These findings enhance
  our understanding of how social media may be used to promote positive health behaviors.
