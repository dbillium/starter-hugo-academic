abstract: Research on subjective authenticity identifies several psychological antecedents
  that seem naturally tied to subjectively authentic experiences. Four studies (N = 525)
  tested the hypothesis that promotion focus (compared to prevention focus) represents
  another shared antecedent of subjective authenticity. Studies 1 and 2 examined correlations
  between regulatory focus and subjective authenticity in the context of goal-pursuit
  and interpersonal interactions. Studies 3 and 4 were within-subjects experiments
  designed to manipulate regulatory focus and examine the effects of promotion and
  prevention focus on subjective authenticity. Across all studies, we found that promotion
  focus (relative to prevention focus) was a robust predictor of subjective authenticity.
  Implications and future directions are discussed.
