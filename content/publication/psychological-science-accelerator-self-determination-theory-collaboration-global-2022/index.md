abstract: Finding communication strategies that effectively motivate social distancing
  continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. This
  cross-country, preregistered experiment (n = 25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses
  concerning generalizable positive and negative outcomes of social distancing messages
  that promoted personal agency and reflective choices (i.e., an autonomy-supportive
  message) or were restrictive and shaming (i.e., a controlling message) compared
  with no message at all. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses in that
  the controlling message increased controlled motivation (a poorly internalized form
  of motivation relying on shame, guilt, and fear of social consequences) relative
  to no message. On the other hand, the autonomy-supportive message lowered feelings
  of defiance compared with the controlling message, but the controlling message did
  not differ from receiving no message at all. Unexpectedly, messages did not influence
  autonomous motivation (a highly internalized form of motivation relying on one’s
  core values) or behavioral intentions. Results supported hypothesized associations
  between people’s existing autonomous and controlled motivations and self-reported
  behavioral intentions to engage in social distancing. Controlled motivation was
  associated with more defiance and less long-term behavioral intention to engage
  in social distancing, whereas autonomous motivation was associated with less defiance
  and more short- and long-term intentions to social distance. Overall, this work
  highlights the potential harm of using shaming and pressuring language in public
  health communication, with implications for the current and future global health
  challenges.
