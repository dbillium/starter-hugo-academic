abstract: Authentic self-expression is associated with many positive well-being outcomes,
  but do these benefits persist when the self being expressed is callous and malevolent?
  Across two studies (total N = 866), we tested the extent to which the relationship
  between authenticity and the quality of interpersonal relationships was moderated
  by Dark Tetrad personality traits. An exploratory study (N = 380) indicated that
  psychopathy significantly moderated the relationship between authenticity and self-esteem,
  depression, hostility, and rocky relationships. A subsequent preregistered confirmatory
  study (N = 486) replicated exploratory findings for both hostility and rocky relationships.
  Authenticity was associated with positive interpersonal relationship quality (less
  rocky relationships and less hostility) when psychopathy was low, but not when psychopathy
  was high. These findings highlight a significant way in which the relationship between
  authentic self-expression and well-being may depend upon the personality traits
  being expressed.
