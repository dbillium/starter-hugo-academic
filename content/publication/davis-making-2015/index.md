abstract: Humor is a multifaceted construct that is generally regarded as a positive
  emotional experience positively associated with well-being. Despite this generally
  accepted relationship, empirical research on humor and meaning (both situational
  meaning and global evaluations of meaning in life) is surprisingly limited. The
  current research examined the relationship between humor and situational meaning
  making in the context of stressful events, as well as general evaluations of meaning
  in life. Study 1 replicated and extended research on the association between humor
  and well-being by assessing the relationship between several aspects of humor and
  ratings of meaning in life. Studies 2 and 3 explored the role of humor in making
  sense of stressful experiences using retrospective and prospective designs. Study
  2 took a retrospective approach to examining the role of humor in coping with stressful
  experiences by having participants reflect on a stressful experience from the previous
  two years. Study 3 prospectively examined the role of humor in meaning making and
  coping with a stressful experience using an expressive writing paradigm. Participants
  in the humor condition were asked to write about a stressful experience they were
  currently dealing with and to specifically make an effort to find humor in the experience.
  Well-being, discrepancy, and meaning making outcomes were assessed 4 weeks later
  to evaluate the effectiveness of effortful attempts to use humor in coping with
  stressful experiences. The results replicated previous research on humor and well-being,
  and supported the hypothesized relationship between healthy/unhealthy humor and
  meaning in life. Humor was also associated with meaning making, however, the role
  of humor in making initial attributions for a potentially stressful experience and
  discrepancies was not clearly supported. Implications, limitations, and future directions
  are discussed.
