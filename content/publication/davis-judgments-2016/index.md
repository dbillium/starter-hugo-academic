abstract: The primary aim of the current studies was to test whether religiousness
  interacted with self-reported levels of meaning in life (MIL) to predict the ease
  or difficulty in judging one's MIL, the search for meaning itself, and religious
  doubt. Undergraduate students in Study 1 (N = 111) and adult participants recruited
  online in Study 2 (N = 206) completed measures of religious beliefs, MIL, cognitive
  fluency related to MIL, and related variables. Study 3 merged these data sets. In
  Study 4 (N = 255), online participants completed measures of religious beliefs,
  cognitive fluency related to religious beliefs, and MIL. Studies 1 and 2 showed
  that highly religious people with lower MIL reported greater difficulty making their
  MIL judgments than other people. Study 3 showed that they were also more likely
  to search for MIL and that disfluency mediated this effect. Study 4 demonstrated
  that they also reported more difficult judgments of religious beliefs and more religious
  doubts than their religious peers with high MIL. The current studies demonstrate
  that the experience of ease or difficulty associated with MIL judgments represents
  an important yet largely unexamined aspect of MIL. Our findings have implications
  for understanding the cognitive mechanisms underlying responses to meaning threats.
